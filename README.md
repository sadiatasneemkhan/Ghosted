Empowering Your Local Ghost Businesses
<br><br/>

### Problem Definition

Starting a new business can be daunting, especially when resources are limited. Immigrants and elders face additional challenges due to their unfamiliarity with social media nuances. Often, these businesses struggle to gain visibility amidst the plethora of listings on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Their presence gets lost among millions of global entities and diverse sellers, including those from unrelated sectors. They find themselves competing against established businesses with physical locations and individuals selling miscellaneous household items. This lack of a central hub for local ghost businesses leads to scattered approaches, resulting in them going unnoticed and feeling demotivated.
